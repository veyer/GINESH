# HANUMAN
I'm the dancing monkey in a monkey's mind. I don't know how to get out but I'll try to be kind.
I've wasted some time singing songs without rhyme, shitting shits with my mouth for labor, what a crime!
I withdrew from what could've grew, 
poetic, hermetic psychotomimetic,
Nevertheless, with some fucking stress,
This project tries mimicking Syrian rue.
